        <h1>Tamilnadu Property Registration – Charges and Procedure</h1>
        <p>
          The registration or transfer of property in Tamilnadu is managed by

          Prior to negotiating the price of a property and/or entering into a
          property sale agreement, the buyer must first undertake a thorough
          due-diligence of the property to be purchased. Since property laws and

          Once thorough due diligence of the property is complete, and the
          decision is made to go ahead with the purchase, stamp paper must be
          purchased based on the property registration charges. Stamp paper
          vendors must sell stamp paper at face value of the stamp. The Sub
          Registrars, Treasuries, and Assistant Superintendent of stamps,
          Chennai also provide stamp papers along with the stamp paper vendors.
